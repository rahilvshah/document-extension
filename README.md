# DocExt v0.1.1

A Chrome/Edge extension that records your browser actions, captures screenshots in both light and dark themes, and generates step-by-step documentation. Export everything as a ZIP with Markdown and WebP images.

## What's New in v0.1.1

- **Full-viewport screenshots** — no more aggressive cropping; every screenshot shows the complete page with the annotation overlaid at the correct position
- **Multi-action grouped steps** — consecutive clicks on the same page section are merged into one step with numbered orange circle annotations (1, 2, 3…)
- **Popup / ephemeral UI merging** — clicking a trigger button (e.g. "+") then selecting an item from the resulting popup produces one step, using the popup-open screenshot so both annotations are visible
- **Annotate prompt** — after each click, an inline toolbar row asks "Annotate this?" (auto-confirms after 4 s); choosing Skip removes the highlight from that step
- **Faster, more reliable screenshot capture** — clicks are never dropped during dual-theme capture; `stopImmediatePropagation` and a gate mechanism freeze the page state before the screenshot is taken
- **Immediate toolbar dismissal on Stop** — the floating bar disappears as soon as you click Stop, before async cleanup finishes
- **Better dark-mode fidelity** — 300 ms settle time ensures all CSS custom-property-based themes are fully applied before the dark screenshot is taken

## Features

- **Action recording**: captures clicks, text input, dropdowns, form submissions, page navigation, and modals
- **Dual-theme screenshots**: automatically toggles between light and dark themes to capture both versions
- **Element highlighting**: adds an orange border and arrow to the clicked element in each screenshot; numbered circles for grouped multi-action steps
- **Full-viewport screenshots**: every screenshot shows the complete page context — no cropping
- **Grouped steps with numbered annotations**: multiple related clicks on the same page area are combined into one card with a single annotated screenshot
- **Popup-aware merging**: trigger → popup-item sequences are merged into one step using the popup-open screenshot
- **Per-click annotate prompt**: opt out of highlighting a specific step without stopping the recording
- **Inline page editing**: edit text directly on the live page while recording (survives modal close/reopen and page refresh)
- **Auto-generated step titles**: creates readable titles from button labels, ARIA attributes, breadcrumbs, and tooltips
- **Drag-and-drop editor**: reorder, rename, or delete steps after recording
- **ZIP export**: download a `documentation.md` file alongside all screenshots (`step01-light.webp`, `step01-dark.webp`, etc.)

```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+
- Chrome or Edge

### Install and Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev              # starts the server (port 3001) and editor (port 5173)
npm run build:extension  # builds the Chrome extension
```

### Load the Extension

1. Run `npm run build:extension`
2. Open `chrome://extensions` (or `edge://extensions`)
3. Enable **Developer Mode**
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select `packages/extension/dist`

### How to Use

1. Click the DocExt icon in the browser toolbar and press **Start Recording**
2. Use the website normally. A floating bar at the bottom shows the action count and timer.
3. After each click, an **"Annotate …?"** prompt appears in the toolbar. Choose **Keep** (default, auto-confirms after 4 s) or **Skip** to remove the highlight for that step.
4. Click **Edit Page** on the floating bar to change text directly on the page
5. Click **Stop Recording**. The editor opens automatically with the generated steps.
6. Reorder, edit, or delete steps as needed
7. Click **Export ZIP** to download your documentation

## About Theme Flicker (Important)

DocExt captures each visual step in both light and dark mode. To do this, the extension briefly switches the page theme during capture.

- **What you may notice**: a quick light/dark flash right after certain actions (especially clicks in menus, popups, and modals).
- **Why this happens**: the extension takes two screenshots per visual step (light first, dark second), then restores the original theme.
- **Why clicks sometimes feel delayed**: for interactive UI (dropdowns, menu items, popup buttons), DocExt temporarily pauses the original click, captures screenshots, then replays the click to preserve accurate "before-action" screenshots.
- **What is normal**: a short visual flicker and slight interaction delay during recording.
- **What is not normal**: controls becoming permanently unclickable, action counts increasing rapidly without interaction, or repeated looping captures.

If behavior feels stuck, stop recording and start a fresh session on the current page.

## Behavior Notes (What to Expect)

These behaviors are intentional and help keep screenshots and steps consistent:

- **Full-viewport screenshots**: every screenshot shows the complete page — the highlight annotation is overlaid at the element's exact position without any cropping.
- **Multi-action steps**: if you click several related elements in the same area of the page within 30 s, they are automatically grouped into one step. The screenshot is taken before any replays, so all annotated elements are visible together.
- **Popup / trigger merging**: clicking a button that opens a popup, then clicking an item inside the popup, produces a single merged step. The screenshot used is the one captured while the popup was open, so both the trigger button (annotation 1) and the popup item (annotation 2) are visible.
- **Visual vs non-visual events**: dual-theme screenshots are prioritised for visual actions (clicks, modal open/close, page navigation). Text/select/submit events may be recorded without full dual capture to reduce noise and extra flicker.
- **Typing order around clicks**: pending text input is flushed before a click on another control (for example, clicking **Save** after editing a field), so the typed step appears before the save/click step.
- **Submit deduping**: if a submit fires immediately after a captured click, DocExt may treat it as the same user intent to avoid duplicate steps.
- **Highlight targeting is best-effort**: DocExt prefers the clicked control, but highly nested custom UI components can still occasionally highlight a text wrapper or nearby interactive parent.
- **Cross-origin navigation capture**: when moving between different origins (for example, app → OAuth provider), navigation capture may appear as its own step and can have a slightly longer settle delay.
- **Step order stability**: events are uploaded in deterministic order, but very close timestamps from app-side async updates can still create edge-case grouping differences in generated step text.

If a single flow is critical (onboarding, login, checkout), run one clean recording for that flow and avoid switching tabs mid-recording.

## Development

```bash
npm run dev              # server + editor with hot reload
npm run build            # build everything
npm run build:extension  # build the extension only
npm run build:editor     # build the editor only
npm run build:server     # build the server only
```

- Server API: `http://localhost:3001/api`
- Editor dev server: `http://localhost:5173` (proxies API requests to the server)
- Database: `./data/docext.db` (SQLite)
- Screenshots: `./data/screenshots/` (lossless WebP)

## How It Works

1. **Recording**: The content script intercepts `pointerdown` events with `capture: true`, immediately calls `preventDefault()` and freezes the main-world click gate. This preserves the exact page state (hover states, open dropdowns, etc.) before the screenshot. After the screenshot is taken, the gate releases and the click is replayed.

2. **Screenshots**: The service worker hides the floating toolbar, takes a light-theme screenshot, switches to dark theme (300 ms settle to ensure full repaint), takes a dark screenshot, then restores everything. Raw full-viewport images are uploaded to the server.

3. **Annotate prompt**: After each click replays, the floating toolbar shows an inline "Annotate …?" row. The user can choose **Keep** (default, auto-confirms after 4 s) or **Skip**. A Skip sends a `SET_SKIP_HIGHLIGHT` message that marks the event in IndexedDB; the finalize step skips annotation for that event.

4. **Step generation**: On finalize, the server groups consecutive same-area clicks into multi-action steps (within 250 px center-to-center, same page, same scroll position). It then merges trigger → ephemeral pairs (e.g. open-menu → select-item) using the popup-open screenshot. Consecutive input events on the same field are merged, and duplicate adjacent steps are removed.

5. **Annotation**: The server reads each raw screenshot, computes highlight positions (using viewport-to-image scale factors), builds an SVG overlay with orange border boxes and numbered circles, and composites it onto the full-viewport image using `sharp`.

6. **Edit persistence**: When you edit text on the page, the changes are saved to `chrome.storage.local`. A MutationObserver watches for DOM changes and reapplies your edits. If an element is destroyed and recreated (like when a modal reopens), it searches for the element by its original text content as a fallback.

7. **Export**: Produces a ZIP file containing `documentation.md` (with relative image paths) and a `screenshots/` folder with numbered WebP files for both themes.
